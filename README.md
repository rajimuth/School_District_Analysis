We will be using python
## Overview of the school district analysis:
Maria, the chief data scientist for city school districts is responsibe for analyzing information from a varieity of sources and in a variety of formats. Currently, she is tasked with presenting imsights in to  City Schools Testing Proficiency for reading and math in different high schools. These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and distict level. The current analysis involves helping Maria to analyze data on student funding and student standardized test scores.
.

Purpose of this analysis:  
 The goal of this analysis is to help the school board regarding the decison of school budget allotment based on the below analysis. 
Initial analysis was done on the school district data to get the district summary of school such as Total schools in the district, Total students, Total Budget for all schools in the district, Average Math score, Reading score, % of students passing Math, reading, both math and reading.

The second part of the analysis was focused on providing seven key metrics
1) A school summary which had information for each school on school type, total students in each school, total budget for each school, per school capita, average math score, reading score, % of students passing math, reading and both.
2) Identify the Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
3) The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
4) The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
5) School performance based on the budget per student
6) School performance based on the school size 
7) School performance based on the type of school

After the initial analysis, the school board notified maria and her team that the student data file shows evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically, the reading and math grades for Thomas High School.

So the school board has decided to uphold the state testing standards and wants us to reanalyze the data for the above metrics after replacing the math and reading scores for ninth grade in Thomas High school wth NaNs. Rest of the data will be intact and the school distirct analysis was repeated to discuss if these changes affected the over all analysis.
